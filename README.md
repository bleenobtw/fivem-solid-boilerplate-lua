This repository is a basic boilerplate for getting started with Solid in NUI. It contains several helpful utilities and is bootstrapped with `vite`. It is for both browser and in-game based development workflows.

This version of the boilerplate is meant for the CfxLua runtime.

## Requirements
* [Node > v16.20](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (Preferred, but not requried)

*A basic understanding of the modern web development workflow. If you don't know this yet, Solid might not be for you just yet.*

## Getting Started

First clone the repository.

## Installation

*The boilerplate was made using `pnpm` but is still compatible with `npm` & `yarn`*

Install dependencies by navigating to the `web` folder within a terminal of your choice and type `pnpm install` `npm i` or `yarn`.
